- 🔭 I’m currently looking for a new Dayjob, since Freelancing wasn't for my family and I.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NextJS 15 combined with React 19 through Robin Wieruchs course and going through an accessibilty course by Sara Soueidan
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun facts:
    - I wanted to set up a Static Website business, built great looking portfolio pages and then took the whole thing offline again because it was boring work and I dont want to do sales.
    - My first two cats when I was a kid were named Eddie and Sissi. I still have a drawing of them. I am not a cat person, but my Mom is. 
    - I was Bonnie Tyler's tour manager for three days in 2017. 
    - My favorite restaurant is called Bun Pho. They serve south vietnamese food and it is the first restaurant both our kids visited in their lifes.
    - I did three Ironman Triathlons with comparably little training. I wont tell you about it again but i'm very proud of it.
    - I do have dozens of software ideas, started 7% of them and finished 0.5%.
    - I like to dis- and reassemble roadbikes.
