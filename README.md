- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for a new Dayjob, since Freelancing wasn't for my family and I.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NextJS 15 combined with React 19 through Robin Wieruchs course and going through an accessibilty course by Sara Soueidan
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun facts:
    - My first two cats when I was a kid were named Eddie and Sissi. I still have a drawing of them. I am not a cat person, but my Mom is. 
    - I was Bonnie Tyler's tour manager for three days in 2017. 
    - My favorite restaurant is called Bun Pho. They serve southern vietnamese food and both our kids did their first restaurant visits there.
    - I did three Ironman Triathlons with comparably little training. I wont tell you about it again myself but now you know 70% of my identity.
    - I like to dis- and reassemble roadbikes.
