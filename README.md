- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun facts:
    - My first two cats when I was a kid were named Eddie and Sissi. I still have a drawing of them. I never got a pet after moving out.  
    - I was Bonnie Tyler's tour manager for three days in 2017. 
    - My favorite restaurant is called Bun Pho. They serve south vietnamese food and it is the first restaurant both our kids visited in their life.
    - I did three Ironman Triathlons with comparably little training. I wont tell you about it again but i'm very proud of it.
    - I do have dozens of software ideas, started 7% of them and finished 0.5%.
    - I like to disassemble, clean all the parts and then reassemble roadbikes.
